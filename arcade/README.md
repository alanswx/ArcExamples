# New Arcade Folder

Place the files inside here in the root level of the Mister (/media/fat/)

It looks something like this:
``
_newarcade/*.mra
arcade/*.rbf
arcade/mame/*.zip
``


**NOTE:
The pac man and pac man derived MRA files (and .ini files) create MRA and roms that aren't compatible with the released cores. You will see drawing artifacts. We need to update all of those cores.
